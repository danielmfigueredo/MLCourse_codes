# Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the severity of breast cancer using the Mammographic Masses dataset. The dataset contains various features related to mammographic masses and their corresponding severity.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Mammographic Masses dataset, which consists of the following columns:

- `BI_RADS`
- `age`
- `shape`
- `margin`
- `density`
- `severity`

The target variable is `severity`, indicating whether the mass is benign or malignant.
